Reflection: 

    Comparing the computer selection to player selection was the most difficult part of the process. 
    Attempted to compare the selections through a variety of ways, until landing upon the incredibly 
    simple solution to "===" both inputs. Why wasn't this my first thought? 

    Utilizing the for (loop), and learning how to select a random # from a changeable range seems 
    very useful for future use.
